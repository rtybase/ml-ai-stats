# Machine learning, artificial intelligence and statistics demo projects.

This is a collection of various machine learning, artificial intelligence and statistics demo projects:

- [Clustering](https://rawcdn.githack.com/rtybase/ml-ai-stats/d15dd4f44790a6249a642252165ea8e3fe542472/clustering/k-means-clustering.html) - is an implementation of [K-means clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) in HTML5 and JavaScript, also explained [here](https://rtybase.blogspot.com/2011/12/k-means-clustering-algorithm.html).
- [Geometric distribution](https://rawcdn.githack.com/rtybase/ml-ai-stats/d15dd4f44790a6249a642252165ea8e3fe542472/geometric-distribution/odds-calculator.html) - is an implementation of [geometric distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution) in HTML5/JavaScript and Python. It comes with a handy calculator for winning odds.
